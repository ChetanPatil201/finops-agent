here is the updated project details. FinOps Agent Suite PRD
1. Project Overview
Purpose: Build a FinOps agent suite to automate Azure cloud resource analysis and cost optimization, demonstrating advanced AI skills for job applications in cloud/AI engineering roles.
Objective: Create a scalable, stateful multi-agent system using LangGraph and Azure OpenAI to:

Scan Azure resources (e.g., VMs, storage) using Azure Resource Graph.
Analyze costs with Azure Cost Management APIs.
Suggest optimizations (e.g., right-sizing, reserved instances).
Generate summary reports for stakeholders.

Target Audience: Cloud engineers, FinOps teams, and hiring managers evaluating your portfolio for AI engineer or Cloud Solutions Architect roles.
Value Proposition: Automates repetitive FinOps tasks, reduces cloud costs by 10-15% (based on industry benchmarks), and showcases production-grade AI skills with LangGraph and Azure OpenAI.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Core Features

Resource Scanner Agent:
Queries Azure Resource Graph to list resources (e.g., VMs, databases).
Filters by subscription, resource group, or type.
Outputs structured JSON with resource details (e.g., type, size, region).


Cost Analyzer Agent:
Uses Azure Cost Management APIs to fetch cost data.
Analyzes costs by resource, service, or tag.
Identifies high-cost resources or anomalies.


Optimizer Agent:
Suggests cost-saving actions (e.g., resize VMs, switch to reserved instances).
Uses Azure OpenAI to generate human-readable recommendations.
Prioritizes actions based on impact (e.g., cost savings vs. effort).


Report Generator:
Compiles scanner and analyzer outputs into a markdown report.
Includes cost breakdowns, optimization suggestions, and savings estimates.
Supports export to CLI output or file.


Chat Interface:
Allows users to query the system (e.g., “What are my top 5 costly VMs?”).
Uses Azure OpenAI for natural language understanding and context-aware responses.
Maintains conversation state via LangGraph.



2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Process 100+ resources in <10 seconds; API calls optimized with caching.
Security: Use Azure Managed Identity or service principal; store secrets in .env.
Scalability: Handle multiple subscriptions; support async API calls.
Reliability: Error handling for API failures; retry logic with exponential backoff.
Usability: CLI interface with clear commands (e.g., finops scan, finops optimize).
Maintainability: Modular LangGraph nodes; well-documented code for Cursor/ChatGPT.

3. Technical Requirements

Framework: LangGraph for agent orchestration; LangChain for tool integration.
LLM: Azure OpenAI (e.g., gpt-4o-mini) for reasoning and chat.
APIs:
Azure Resource Graph for resource queries.
Azure Cost Management for cost data.
Azure OpenAI for natural language processing.


Language: Python 3.10+.
Dependency Manager: UV for fast, reproducible builds.
IDE: Cursor (paid version) for AI-assisted coding.
Environment: .env for secrets (Azure credentials, OpenAI key).
Output: CLI for interaction; markdown for reports.
